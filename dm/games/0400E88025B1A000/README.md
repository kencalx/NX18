# Star Fox (`0400E88025B1A000`)

A Switch 2 game: update v131072, SDK 21.4.4 built for the Switch 2 (`Ounce`), NVN2 with DLSS. A custom engine (its own prefixes: `vfs`, `vrender`, `vjob`, `vscript`, `vspirv`, `veffects`, `vphysics`; project name `eclipse`), with Wwise 2024.1 for audio, Bullet physics and NPLN for online play. Modules `main`, `sdk`, `subsdk0` (the SDK's movie module), `subsdk3` (`nn::camera`); `subsdk1` (the C library) and `subsdk2` (`NintendoSDK_DLSS`) are shipped but `main` imports nothing from them. **Plays on the Mac** (M4 Pro, 48 GB): the title, the prologue cinematic and the tutorial flight, with sound. The tutorial runs at 56 to 60 fps with a 4K screenshot every 4 s and at 60 without them; the cinematic at 30 fps, which looks like the game's own choice (not checked). Scripted input here reached the tutorial's first lesson and worked its options menus; flying under input has not been watched on this Mac (pull request #1259's author reports 7 minutes of it with a controller on an M5 Max). No IPA has been built.

## What it needs

| Setting | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `mem_alias 0x400000000`, `mem_reserve 0x550000000`, `mem_stack 0x10000000`, `app_pool 0x240000000` | [`game.tsv`](game.tsv) | the Switch 2's 9 GB. The alias region mapped up to +8.26 GB of its 16 GB, 6.78 GB at most at once, through the tutorial's start; 8.5 GB resident, 4 GB of it allocated on the GPU |
| `sys_resource 0x1000000` | `game.tsv` | the NPDM declares 16 MB, so virtual address memory is on; `main` never sets a heap |
| `modules main subsdk0 subsdk3 sdk` | `game.tsv` | `main` imports 17 movie functions from `subsdk0` and 19 `nn::camera` functions from `subsdk3`, nothing from `subsdk1` or `subsdk2` |
| `romfs_marker data.zip` | `game.tsv` | the RomFS has two files, and this is the game |
| `zip_store .zip:.metallib` | `game.tsv` | the archive's members are LZ4-compressed already |
| `shader_groups /data.zip=shader` | `game.tsv` | every shader is a member of the archive |
| `depth_mode zero` | `game.tsv` | the game sets near = 0 with `nvnDeviceSetDepthMode` before its first frame, so the pipeline bases made before it runs (the app's archive made offline, the Mac prebuild) need the `main0_z` vertex entries; without it a Mac app's 66.5 MB archive was refused and its first start built 1,483 bases before the first frame ([below](#found-on-this-game)) |

There is no game-specific patch, and only v131072's build row: the base game, v0, has not been run.

## Files

- A NUP container of 30 GB: a base package (v0) and an update package (v131072), each with its own ExeFS and RomFS. Neither package carries a NACP or an icon, so the name comes from the profile, the display version is the placeholder `v131072`, and the app gets the NX 18 icon (`--icon` gives it the game's).
- The RomFS is two files: `data.zip` (14.5 GB) and `veclipse_build.cvar` (a JSON line: `system.is_shipping_build: true`). `main` opens `rom:/data.zip` through its own virtual file system (`vfs.zip.c`): [LZ4-chained zip members behind a VZIP preamble](../../../docs/reference/shaders.md#lz4-chained-zip-members-behind-a-vzip-preamble-and-shader-binaries-of-one-stage). Its 114,154 members are named by a 16-digit hash with no folders or extensions; 92,069 are chained, 22,085 (the Wwise `RIFF` sound files and `BKHD` banks) stored plain.
- `main` is 192 MB of code with 1,036 imports, of which the host and the other modules supply all but two (gRPC thread-local initialisers, `_ZTH…`). No shader is in any code module.

## Shaders

2,856 in [`shader_map.tsv`](shader_map.tsv): 1,483 vertex, 1,305 pixel, 68 compute; 2,828 one per archive member, no task or mesh shaders, and the rest from the two NDSR upscaler networks embedded in `VIPR` containers. All of them translate. A build takes about 4 minutes in all on an M4 Pro. Each member is the engine's shader binary (`_vrender_shader_binary_t`), read as a single-stage program and paired at draw time (`separable_pairs`: 1,480 cover pairs).

## The picture

Every 3D target is 768x432 from the first frame of the title to the tutorial: MetalFX stands in for DLSS at 768x432 to 768x432, the game's NDSR compute networks take that to 1536x864, and the result reaches the 3840x2160 swap chain, whose top-left 1920x1080 holds the picture. The game's own defaults give the reason for the figure, not the cause: `render.dynres_min_scale_x` is 0.5 and `max` 1.0, so 768x432 is the minimum of a 1536x864 base, at 6 to 11 ms of GPU time a frame on the M4 Pro. Segment timestamps (the profile key `gpu_timestamps segment` then, the host's default since) changed nothing, with the GPU's idle gaps still counted. Whether a console stays there too is not known.

## Driving it on the Mac

`python3 scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py <folder> --platform mac` builds the Mac shaders and the host and prints the run command. Headless, through `DM_CTL`: the title is up about 40 s after boot and `A` starts the game. The prologue cinematic follows, about 4 minutes on every run (a save holds no progress yet, and skipping it was not tried), then the tutorial's first question, about 300 s after boot: `LDown`, `A` answers no. Shots of the swap chain hold the picture in their top-left quarter. A `shot` takes about 165 ms: a hitch every few seconds in a run that takes them is the shot's.

## Found on this game

- [Offline pipeline archive and profile depth disagree](../../../docs/reference/shaders.md#offline-pipeline-archive-and-profile-depth-disagree): the profile had no `depth_mode`, so a release-1 Mac app (M4 Max, `applegpu_g16s`) carried an archive made for near = −w, and the host refused it (`made for … depth near=-w … this run needs … depth near=0`): its first start built all 1,483 pairs' bases itself (6.3 s, the first frame at 6.6 s). With `depth_mode zero` the app rebuilt from the same build folder (only the archive's 1,483 bases compiled again, 12 s; shaders, rewrite and host libraries unchanged) is taken: `holds the bases of every shader pair (16 of 16 probed bases found)`, no prebuild, the first frame at 1.4 s. On the same headless route (title, prologue, the tutorial's ring course, about 11 minutes) the draws still compiled 346 bases in play, as before, with 0 archive lookups found in both runs: the bases they wait for are not the ones the archive or the prebuild holds ([Open](#open)). The prologue's longest frames were 4.0, 1.2, 0.9 and 0.8 s (against 5.9, 2.0, 1.1 and 0.7 s), with the Mac under a load average near 30 from other builds, so their lengths are not comparable; the counts are. The iPhone archive (`applegpu_g19p`, `dm/ios/tools/build_ipa.sh`) takes the depth from the same key and would have been refused the same way; with the key it holds `main0_z` entries (planned with `--script-only`, not run on a device).

## Open

- Draws compile their pipeline bases in play (346 on the route, the prologue's 0.6 to 4 s frames among them) although the app's archive holds a base for every shader pair: `archive lookups found 0`, `misses with no pulling base ready`, `draws with a hybrid pipeline 0`. Why their lookups miss is not known.
- [The picture](#the-picture): why the 3D stays at 768x432.
- `[RED] DLSS: the game's bias mask (a reactive mask for MetalFX) is not passed on`.
- The game's wake-up eventfd fails (the host refuses `nn::socket::EventFd`), so its HTTP thread polls without a wake-up; harmless offline.
- A `pso_manifest.tsv` has not been recorded; `render_cond` not tried; the later levels and combat, and iOS, not tested.
- Mario Kart World 1.8.0 has not been run with the camera answers changed for this game.
