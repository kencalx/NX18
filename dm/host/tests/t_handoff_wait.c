// The cost of a same-core handoff's wait (dm_yield_to_core_peers), and what the in-game menu's focus pair leaves behind.
// Catherine: Full Body's main thread (priority 44, core 0) and job_update_0 (priority 43, core 0) trade a lock 5,000-6,200 times a second in some scenes: each release wakes
// the worker, the main thread waits until it blocks again, and the worker blocks after 5-20 µs. The wait was a loop of 50 µs nanosleeps, so every handoff cost at least one
// timer wakeup: on the iPhone 18 Pro Max wakeups went from about 2,300 to 6,300-6,700 a second and the CPU moved to the performance cores (0.03-0.05 → 0.47 W) at 30 fps.
// The owner saw it right after closing NX 18's menu, whose focus pair (2, then 1) under focus handling mode 0 changes nothing the wait reads; this test plays that pair first.
// Real thread SVCs: the worker is a guest thread made by CreateThread, woken by an event as the game's lock wakes it, and the main thread's SignalEvent waits for it
