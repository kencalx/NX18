// The suspend's drain with a limit (nvn_mtl.m mtl_drain_by; hle_nvn.c dm_gfx_suspend runs it on its own thread going to the background) with real Metal 4. Ocarina of Time's
// test 3 froze once and the background path then never returned; every wait on the drain's path now ends at the limit and the drain names the step. Each case fakes one step
// that never completes: a present on the GPU the display link owns (present_drop_for_suspend), a snapshot copy the encode thread never notes (snap_drain's rec_note_wait; it no
// longer stops the process), a one-off command buffer whose completion is held behind a stuck feedback handler (once_wait), a fence nothing completes and an upload batch never
// reported back (mtl_finish_gpu). Each returns within the limit plus 150 ms with its step's name and leaves no limit on the thread; once let go, the plain mtl_drain finishes,
// and mtl_drain_by with nothing stuck returns NULL. t_gfx_suspend checks dm_gfx_suspend's own bound and lines
