// CPU-only lifecycle regression: the real NVN submit entry and graphics gate, with the prepare step (mtl_prepare) held by semaphores and the Metal replay and drain stubbed.
// Going to the background while the first submission prepares must not wait for it, and a second submission queued behind it must not hold the suspend either (docs/reference/nvn-objects.md,
// "Going to the background during the prepare step").
// The suspend's limit (hle_nvn.c dm_gfx_suspend, after Ocarina of Time's test 3 froze and the background path never returned): with a graphics call that never returns (a faked
// in-flight count), a drain held where no wait has a limit, and a drain whose waits end at the limit (nvn_mtl.m mtl_drain_by, stubbed here), going to the background returns in
// about 3 s with "[RED] suspend: the GPU did not drain in 3 s" naming what, and the dump; graphics stay suspended; a resume while it still does not drain keeps them suspended
// within about 1 s and says so; once the drain finishes, the resume is a normal one, and a resume that could not drain is tried again in the foreground until it does (a suspend
// ends that). t_suspend_drain checks mtl_drain_by's own waits with real Metal
