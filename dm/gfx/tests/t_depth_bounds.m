// Depth bounds (nvnCommandBufferSetDepthBounds → OP_DEPTH_BOUNDS → Metal's depth bounds test) through public NVN recording and the real replay. The Mac test host (M4 Max, Apple9)
// has no depth bounds test, and Metal's validation stops the process at the encoder call there, so the GPU half cannot run here. What runs: how nvn_dbnd.h reads bounds (clamped
// to [0, 1], off at (0, 1), nothing passing for min above max or a NaN); on this GPU, that a game turning the test on makes no encoder call and draws as if it were off; then, with
// the GPU taken as having it (g_dbnd_hw) and the encoder call taken by g_dbnd_test_enc, the calls the replay makes: the bounds at the first draw, none for a draw with the same bounds,
// again after a copy splits the pass, (0, 1) when the game turns the test off and around a clear inside the pass, none in a pass without depth; draws whose bounds pass nothing are
// skipped (their pixels checked) where the GPU has the test and drawn where it has not, and DM_DEPTH_BOUNDS=0 ignores all of it. Under DM_NVN_TBDR=1 a pass whose draws test
// neither depth nor write it but have bounds keeps its depth attached (pass_ds_need), a first draw with bounds keeps the colour load (first_draw_covers), a draw with bounds after
// a same-target continuation splits the pass to attach the depth, and the readable-tile merge refuses a later-pass draw with bounds against the earlier pass's depth; with the GPU taken
// as lacking the test (g_dbnd_hw 0) none of that planning changes (dbnd_live): the same passes, loads and stores with the bounds on as off, and the merge taken. Every submission runs under MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1 (make GAME=<id> check_t_depth_bounds), which
// would stop at a depth bounds call reaching this GPU's encoder
