// Depth bounds test: the bounds a draw runs with, from what the game set (nvnCommandBufferSetDepthBounds, recorded as OP_DEPTH_BOUNDS). The Switch's GPU passes a fragment when the depth already stored at its sample lies in [min, max], as GL's EXT_depth_bounds_test and
// Vulkan define it, and Metal's -setDepthTestMinBound:maxBound: tests the stored depth the same way. Metal takes only 0 <= min <= max <= 1 and reads (0, 1) as the test turned off.
// The stored depth is always in [0, 1], so a bound outside it is the same as the bound clamped; bounds that no stored depth can meet (min above max, min above 1, max below 0, or a NaN,
// which fails every comparison on the GPU) pass nothing, and on a GPU with the test the replay skips those draws instead of handing Metal bounds it refuses; a GPU without the
// test draws them, as every draw, as before the test was applied.
// Pure C so the tests share it (t_depth_bounds.m)
